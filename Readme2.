## Deepfake and Virtual Camera Implementation Guide

The following tools and configurations enable high-performance face-swapping and remote streaming for live video calls (KYC, testing, or demonstrations).

### Core Software and Performance

* **DeepFaceLab / DeepFaceLive:** Compatible with CUDA out of the box. macOS (MPS) support requires additional configuration but is functional.
* **Performance Metric:** An M4 Max chip can achieve **30fps** at 224 resolution.


* **FaceFusion / iRoopDeepFaceCam:** Effective alternatives for face-swapping without the need for extensive model training.
* **Performance Metric:** An NVIDIA 2080ti achieves **20–30fps**.

### Virtual Camera and Audio Routing

To inject deepfake feeds into communication platforms like Zoom, use **OBS Studio** to create a virtual camera device. For environments with device allow-listing or geofencing, remote feeds can be tunneled into a local webcam via **VDO.Ninja**.

**Audio Tunneling Tools:**

* **macOS:** BlackHole
* **Windows:** VB-Audio CABLE (VAC)

### Remote Streaming and Connectivity

For streaming from a GPU-enabled server to a local laptop, the **NDI plugin** for OBS is utilized.

| Component | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| **Protocol** | Use **TCP** rather than UDP to avoid common NDI streaming bugs. |
| **Plugin** | OBS-NDI for remote GPU processing. |
| **Logic** | Process the video on a high-spec server and output the result to a client device via NDI. |
