Deepfake and Virtual Camera Implementation GuideThe following tools and configurations enable high-performance face-swapping and remote streaming for live video calls (KYC, testing, or demonstrations).Core Software and PerformanceDeepFaceLab / DeepFaceLive: Compatible with CUDA out of the box. macOS (MPS) support requires additional configuration but is functional.Performance Metric: An M4 Max chip can achieve 30fps at 224 resolution.FaceFusion / iRoopDeepFaceCam: Effective alternatives for face-swapping without the need for extensive model training.Performance Metric: An NVIDIA 2080ti achieves 20–30fps.Virtual Camera and Audio RoutingTo inject deepfake feeds into communication platforms like Zoom, use OBS Studio to create a virtual camera device. For environments with device allow-listing or geofencing, remote feeds can be tunneled into a local webcam via VDO.Ninja.Audio Tunneling Tools:macOS: BlackHoleWindows: VB-Audio CABLE (VAC)Remote Streaming and ConnectivityFor streaming from a GPU-enabled server to a local laptop, the NDI plugin for OBS is utilized.ComponentRecommendationProtocolUse TCP rather than UDP to avoid common NDI streaming bugs.PluginOBS-NDI for remote GPU processing.LogicProcess the video on a high-spec server and output the result to a client device via NDI.
