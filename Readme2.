# Deepfake Live-Streaming & Virtual Camera Setup

This repository outlines the technical stack and configuration required to implement real-time deepfakes for live video calls (e.g., Zoom, KYC verification). This setup supports high-performance face-swapping on both NVIDIA (CUDA) and Apple Silicon (MPS) hardware.

## Core Hardware & Performance Benchmarks

Real-time performance varies based on hardware architecture and model resolution.

| Hardware | Software | Performance | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Apple M4 Max** | DeepFaceLive | 30 FPS @ 224px | Requires MPS configuration |
| **NVIDIA 2080ti** | FaceFusion / iRoop | 20–30 FPS | Standard CUDA execution |

## Software Stack

### 1. Face Swapping Tools

* [DeepFaceLive](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLive): Best for high-resolution models. Works out-of-the-box with CUDA; requires "fiddling" for macOS MPS.
* [FaceFusion](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion): A comprehensive tool for face-swapping and enhancement.
* [iRoopDeepFaceCam](https://github.com/iVideoGameBoss/iRoopDeepFaceCam): A streamlined face-swap alternative that often removes the need for extensive model training.

### 2. Video & Audio Routing

* **OBS Studio:** Used as the primary hub to manage video layers and output a **Virtual Camera**.
* **VDO.Ninja:** Enables injecting a remote live feed into a local webcam, useful for bypassing geofencing or device allow-listing.
* **Audio Drivers:**
* **macOS:** [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole)
* **Windows:** [VB-Audio CABLE](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)



### 3. Remote Streaming (Server-to-Client)

To run heavy processing on a GPU server and stream the output to a local laptop:

* **Plugin:** [OBS-NDI](https://github.com/obs-ndi/obs-ndi)
* **Protocol:** Use **TCP** instead of UDP to ensure stability and avoid common NDI streaming bugs.

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Processing:** Run the deepfake software (DeepFaceLive/FaceFusion) on the GPU-enabled machine.
2. **Capture:** Use OBS Studio to capture the software's output window.
3. **Tunneling (Optional):** If the destination requires a specific local device, use VDO.Ninja to send the server feed to the local client.
4. **Virtual Output:** Start the **OBS Virtual Camera** and select it as the input in the target application (Zoom, etc.).
5. **Audio:** Route audio through BlackHole or VB-Audio CABLE to ensure synchronized sound alongside the video feed.
